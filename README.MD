## Project Introduction

The "Alzheimer's Disease Dataset" from Kaggle provides a comprehensive set of health information for 2,149 patients. The dataset includes a variety of features such as demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). These features can offer great insights into the interplay of various factors contributing to AD.

The goal of this project is to apply and compare several machine learning classification algorithms to predict the presence of AD based on the provided data. By leveraging these algorithms, we seek to identify the most effective model for predicting AD status.

### Objectives:

- **Descriptive:** Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships among different features.
- **Predictive:** Evaluate various machine learning classification algorithms to predict AD status.
- **Techniques:** Implement and compare the following supervised learning techniques to determine the most accurate and reliable model for binary classification:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Research Question

How effective are different machine learning classification algorithms in predicting AD based on extensive patient health information? Specifically, which algorithm provides the highest accuracy and reliability for early detection of AD?

**Assumptions** (_Hypothesis_)

1. When symptoms appear after the age of 60, it implies late-onset AD which is the most common form of the disease. Family history of dementia is a known risk factor for developing late-onset AD. Therefore, I expect that family history is a factor contributing to AD. Therefore, it could be highly positively correlated with AD positives. Is that true, given the dataset?

2. Does education level affect AD? :trollface:
